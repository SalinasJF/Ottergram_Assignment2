# Ottergram_Assignment2
Assignment 2 of Ottergram. CPSC_473
Project creates a webpage for dynamically changing images. For Assignment two, I used a switch case statement
that detects what the current detail-image is. Then returned the position for increment and decrement when
next and previous buttons were clicked.
